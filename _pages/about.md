I am Thanh Le (Lê Viết Lưu Thanh), a Math PhD student at UNL since Fall 2022. My office is AVH 241. Here is [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanhle30/). 

Please contact me via email: *tle51[at]huskers[dot]unl[dot]edu*

I completed my Master degree in Mathematics at UNL in 2023. Before that, I completed my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Fairfield University in 2022.

## Research
My advisor is [Dr. Xavier Pérez Giménez](https://www.math.unl.edu/~xperezgimenez2/ "Xavier's homepage"). My research interest is **Probabilistic Combinatorics**. We are working on a project about thresholds for Hamitonicity in directed random graphs with some degree conditions.

In Spring 2025, I am going to be a Graduate Research Assistant for [Dr. Vinod Variyam](https://cse.unl.edu/~vinod/ "Vinod's homepage"). We are probably working on theoretical Machine Learning, in particular the Transformer architecture.  

## Recent news
- Fall 2024: I gave a talk in the Discrete Seminar (DisCo) of UNL's Math department. The talk was titled "Thresholds in random graphs and the Kahn-Kalai Conjecture." Here are [my slides](/files/Talk-Nov24-KahnKalaiConjecture.pdf).
- 08/05-08/09/2024: I attended [Minicourse: Synergies of probabilistic and extremal combinatorics](https://viasm.edu.vn/hdkh/minicourse-synergies-of-probabilistic-and-extremal-combinatorics) in Hanoi, Vietnam.

## Materials
- UNL Putnam Seminar 2024: Here are some resources that I created: [Proof by Contradiction](/files/Putnam/Putnam_240926_PfByContrad.pdf), [Induction](/files/Putnam/Putnam_241017_Induction.pdf), [Extremal Heuristic](/files/Putnam/Putnam_241114_ExtremalHeuristics.pdf). I did not write up solutions, but contact me if you want to know where to find solutions! 
- In Spring 2024, I had a reading course on the first 4 chapters of *Probability: Theory and Examples* by Rick Durrett. I wrote up some [key concepts](/files/Durrett_Book_Theory.pdf) and a few [exercises](/files/Durrett_Book_Exercises.pdf).

## Other Stuff
My hobbies: Soccer, Writing. I maintain a little blog in Vietnamese [here \(Facebook page\)](https://www.facebook.com/thanhlewriter).

Micellaneous cool stuff:
- This site was so easy to create, thanks to [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/). No coding experience required, totally free - I highly recommend

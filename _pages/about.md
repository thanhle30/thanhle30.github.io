I am **Thanh Le (Lê Viết Lưu Thanh), a Math PhD Candiate at UNL** (expected graduation May 2027). Here is [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanhle30/). 

Please contact me via email: *tle51[at]huskers[dot]unl[dot]edu*

I completed my **MS in Math at UNL in 2023**, and **BS in CS and Math at Fairfield University in 2022**.

## Research
I am co-advised by [Dr. Xavier Pérez Giménez](https://www.math.unl.edu/~xperezgimenez2/ "Xavier's homepage") and  [Dr. Vinod Variyam](https://cse.unl.edu/~vinod/ "Vinod's homepage"). My current research topics are: 
- **Probabilistic Combinatorics** (with Dr. Pérez Giménez): We have been working on a project about thresholds for Hamitonicity in directed random graphs with some degree conditions.
- **Deep Learning** (mostly with Dr. Variyam's team): We study what the theoretical capabilities and limitations of Transformers (a deep learning architecture). Typical papers in this research line include [Hahn 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06755), [Strobl et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00208) (a survey).     

## Recent news
- Fall 2025 and Spring 2026: I am co-organizing UNL's Discrete Seminar (DisCo). 
- June 2025: I am attending [SLMath's summer school "Local Limits of Random Graph"](https://www.slmath.org/summer-schools/1099) at Paris-Saclay University, France
- May 2025: I gave a talk in the Discrete Seminar (DisCo) of UNL's Math department. The talk was titled "On the existence of Hamilton cycles with a periodic pattern in a random digraph with degree at least 2."
- April 2025: I attended Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory at UIC.

## Materials
- UNL Putnam Seminar 2024: Here are some resources that I created: [Proof by Contradiction](/files/Putnam/Putnam_240926_PfByContrad.pdf), [Induction](/files/Putnam/Putnam_241017_Induction.pdf), [Extremal Heuristic](/files/Putnam/Putnam_241114_ExtremalHeuristics.pdf). I did not write up solutions, but contact me if you want to know where to find solutions! 
- In Spring 2024, I had a reading course on the first 4 chapters of *Probability: Theory and Examples* by Rick Durrett. I wrote up some [key concepts](/files/Durrett_Book_Theory.pdf) and a few [exercises](/files/Durrett_Book_Exercises.pdf).

## Other Stuff
My hobbies: Soccer, Writing. I maintain a little blog in Vietnamese [here \(Facebook page\)](https://www.facebook.com/thanhlewriter).

Micellaneous cool stuff:
- This site was so easy to create, thanks to [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/). No coding experience required, totally free - I highly recommend.
